<h1>Board@Work</h1>
This is a workplace message board, built to simplify the process of keeping remote workers in the loop. In a distraction free, work focused environment, employees can quickly and easily scan for the latest work updates without getting sidetracked by social media or losing the notices in their email. Employers have a quick and easy centralized location for updating all their employees at once
